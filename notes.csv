Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors,"It's one of the most unusual films I've seen, a barrage of images, music and noises, shot with such an active camera we almost need seatbelts.",5
Earth,"The film is told as a melodrama and romance, not docudrama, and that makes it all the more effective.",4
Vechir na Ivana Kupala,I was very lucky recording this movie on VHS in 2001 on the french / German Arte TV-Channel. It's in the same line as Sergei Parjanov's 'shadows of forgotten ancestors' from 1964. Yuri Iljenko did most of the camera work for 'Shadows'.,2
